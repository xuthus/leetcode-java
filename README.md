Leetcode solutions

The repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems from leetcode.com. I prefer to use Java, but may be I will solve some problems in other languages.

Solutions do not pretend to be absolutely correct. They are all accepted by leetcode.com, but there are certainly more optimal solutions. For some problems I'll post a few solutions with different algorithms.

You can, if you want, add your own solutions or improve mine. If you offer a fundamentally different solution, it is better to add it to a separate class (may be extract base interface), if you just optimize my solution, you can edit it and request me to merge your editions.

All solutions are equipped with tests implemented on JUnit4.

To build and run tests, I use Maven.

You can freely use the repository to study algorithms. I also recommend you to register on leetcode.com.

Good luck!
